The ChV1 form must be opened in Adobe Reader, it cannot be filled within your web browser e.g. Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox etc… 
If you are having trouble opening the file or just see ‘Please wait…’ display then try right clicking and ‘Save linked file as’ or ‘Save target as’ then open the chv1.pdf file manually in Adobe Reader from the ‘File’ menu.
