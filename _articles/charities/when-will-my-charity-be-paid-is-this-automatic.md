By default charities are generally paid out every 7 days on a Monday.
<br>
<p>
<em>Note:- The following information pertains to our legacy payouts system</em>
<br>The PayPal Giving Fund pay out donations received in monthly lump sums, usually towards the end of a month. The Gift Aid associated with these donations is then normally paid out the month following. This is all done automatically, and will be transferred directly to the bank account you set up with them.

You will also receive an email confirmation from them detailing the payment made. Givey donations are often listed as a 'Donation as Service'.

You can see your charity's Payout Dates which we receive from the PayPal Giving Fund if you are the administrator for the charity page. If you are not but want this access, set up a Givey username at www.givey.com/signup and send your charity name and your Givey Username to support@givey.com. You will then be able to click 'Settings' when you log in and switch to the charity profile on the right. You then will be shown a list of options such as Exports, Payouts and Fundraiser information.</p>
