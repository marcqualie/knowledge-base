All we need you to do to make the most of this new system is to log in to Givey, switch to your charity profile and add the charity bank details in Settings. When all these sections are complete they will display a green tick - if any sections are not complete your charity will not receive payments. You can also complete a Gift Aid from which will allow us to collect Gift Aid on your behalf. Just pop this back to us in the post and we'll do the rest. Nothing will change for your donors and supporters.
