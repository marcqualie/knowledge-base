As soon as you send it to us, we check that it's correct and then send it on to the HMRC. This can take them from 2 weeks to a few months to process, and unfortunately we cannot make this process and speedier. Gift Aid is retrospective however, so whilst your waiting users can continue to click the Gift Aid box and it will be received eventually by your charity.
