If you don’t have access to your Charity admin page, simply:<br/><ol><li>Sign up at www.givey.com/signup if you haven’t already</li><li>This will generate your username [the name you choose for your user profile to be recognised by, e.g. givey.com/myusername] </li><li>Send this to support@givey.com along with your Charity name where we will be able to grant you this access.</li></ol>
