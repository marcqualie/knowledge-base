If you have an inspiring idea and want to help others, projects is the place for you! You don't have to be from the UK or even a registered charity, you just need to have the initiative to create solutions for those in need. We will allow groups or organisations that wish to help others use our unique content donation mechanism, the Givey Share, to raise the funds they need to alleviate some of the worldâ€™s most prominent crises and concerns. For more information on how this has come about, check out this video from our founder: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eya7c8p7GdE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
