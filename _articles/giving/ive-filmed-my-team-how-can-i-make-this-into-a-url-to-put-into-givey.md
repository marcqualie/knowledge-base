Ok, no problem. If you have a YouTube account, just upload the video and use the generated URL. If you don’t, add the video to your usual social networking site and copy the link once the media has uploaded. You can then paste this into Givey and donate through the content. Alternatively, film them using Instagram, and copy the link directly from there.
