The 5% fee for users is in order to cover these new transactional and vetting costs and to keep Givey a free platform for projects and charities. Rather then deduct the charge from your donation as many sites do, we will add this to your total charged amount. For example a Â£10 donation will only cost an extra 50p, and will still gain + 25% from Gift Aid (where applicable). Givey will remain completely free for charities and projects to register with and we won't deduct any costs from your donation amount. As a social enterprise striving to do good and make change, we value transparency and hope you understand what has been a difficult decision to make, but it is one that ensures we can keep providing our service and be able to expand globally to help even more people. In order to remain free for users we are also launching a 'fees covered by' service which you'll have seen trialled on the site. Businesses can cover the 5% cost and be part of wonderful moments of giving!

<strong> 100% of every donation + Gift Aid will still go to the charity of your choice. We will not deduct the fee from a users donation amount.</strong>
