A Givey Share describes a post that connects a web link with a donation through Givey. Sharing on Givey must be linked to a donation - the act that turns your feelings into doing something proactive to make a difference. 
<br>Go to <strong><a href="https://www.givey.com/fundraise">How to Fundraise</a></strong> to find out more and see our guides! We will still show you your fundraising total on the Givey Share, so you can see how close you are to your target. Share the post within your social networks or send the post link out on an email to start the funds rolling in!</br>
