If your business is already enabled on Givey, simply log in, click 'Edit my Settings' from your profile image avatar, switch to the business profile on the left and select 'Pre-Approvals'. Each pre approval limit is £1,000 so if you wanted to pre-approve £5,000 as your yearly limit, you'll just need to add five pre-approvals. If you do not get through the full amount you've pre-approved in your designated year, then you will need to go into your account to confirm you're still happy to have this money pre-approved fro the next year.
